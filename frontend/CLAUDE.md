### 🔧 **CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETED** (September 16, 2025)

#### **Phase 5: Homepage Display Crisis - RESOLVED** ✅
**Issue**: Homepage was not showing any approved projects due to critical database field mismatch
**Root Cause**: Backend SQL queries were selecting `p.image_url` but database column is `logo_url`
**Impact**: Complete failure of `/api/projects/approved` endpoint with "Unknown column error"

✅ **Backend Database Field Consistency**:
- Fixed all SQL queries in `/home/ubuntu/zuvomo-backend/routes/projects.js` (lines 115, 132, 660, 943, 973, 983)
- Fixed SQL queries in `/home/ubuntu/zuvomo-backend/routes/watchlist.js` (line 55)
- Updated all `image_url` → `logo_url` references for database schema alignment
- Fixed data transformation mapping to ensure `logo_url` → `image` in API responses

✅ **Frontend Field Mapping Enhancement**:
- Enhanced Homepage image handling in `/src/pages/Index.tsx` (line 114)
- Updated ProjectOwnerDashboard image mapping in multiple locations (lines 680, 712, 2086)
- Added comprehensive fallbacks: `image || image_url || logo_url || '/placeholder.svg'`
- Robust handling of all possible image field variations

✅ **Production Deployment**:
- Built frontend with critical fixes (`index-DVZYXhxQ.js`, `index-DyINg3to.css`)

#### **Phase 7: Blog & Case Study System - COMPLETE VERIFICATION** ✅ (September 17, 2025)

**🎯 Comprehensive System Verification**:
After thorough testing and debugging, the complete blog and case study management system is now fully operational.

**✅ Critical Backend Fixes Applied**:
1. **MySQL Prepared Statement Issue**: Fixed `LIMIT ? OFFSET ?` parameterized queries that were causing "Incorrect arguments to mysqld_stmt_execute" errors
   - **Root Cause**: MySQL prepared statements don't support parameterized LIMIT/OFFSET clauses
   - **Solution**: Changed to string interpolation `LIMIT ${limitNum} OFFSET ${offset}` following working patterns from projects API
   - **Files Fixed**: `/home/ubuntu/zuvomo-backend/routes/blogs.js` and `/home/ubuntu/zuvomo-backend/routes/case-studies.js`

2. **Database Column Reference Errors**: Removed non-existent `u.profile_image` column references
   - **Issue**: Blog queries were trying to SELECT profile_image from users table (column doesn't exist)
   - **Solution**: Updated queries to only select existing user columns (first_name, last_name)

3. **Query Result Destructuring**: Fixed improper array destructuring in count queries
   - **Issue**: `const [{ total }] = await executeQuery(...)` was failing
   - **Solution**: Changed to proper array access `const countResult = await executeQuery(...); const total = countResult[0].total;`

**✅ Database Layer Verification**:
- ✅ **Tables Created**: `blog_posts` (3 entries), `case_studies` (3 entries), `blog_categories` all exist with correct schema
- ✅ **Sample Data**: Professional content with featured images, tags, and proper author relationships
- ✅ **Relationships**: User-blog author relationships working correctly (admin@zuvomo.com as author)

**✅ Backend API Layer Verification**:

  - `GET /api/blogs` → Returns 3 blog posts with pagination, author info, and featured images
  - `GET /api/case-studies` → Returns 3 case studies with metrics, testimonials, and complete data
- ✅ **Admin Endpoints Protected**: 
  - `GET /api/blogs/admin/all` → Returns 401 Unauthorized (properly protected)
